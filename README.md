# tic-tac-toe-game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Python. The game allows two players to take turns and play on a 3x3 grid. The first player uses 'X' and the second player uses 'O'. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
